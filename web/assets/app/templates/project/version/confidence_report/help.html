<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
    Issues are imported from Jira with all their sub-tasks and linked bugs.
    After importing some information is aggregated and saved.
</p>
<h4>Columns</h4>
<p>
    The <strong>Assignees</strong> field shows the aggregated information about assignees.
    <br>In simple mode only the developers are shown.
        In detailed mode (see "Expand Assignees" below) the testing-developeris also shown.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Status</strong> field shows the aggregated issue status.
    <br>It may be one of: Open, In progress, Doc, In TBD, In QA, Resolved, Done.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>CL</strong> field shows the
        <a href="https://wiki.symmetrics.de/display/TEAMLEADS/Confidence+levels+reporting+guidelines">Confidence Level</a>
        of the issue.
</p>
<p>See "Filtering issues" section below to learn how to filter by assignees, status or CL.</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Impl</strong>, <strong>Doc</strong>, <strong>TBD</strong>, <strong>TC</strong>,
        <strong>QA</strong> and <strong>CR</strong> fields are calculated dynamically.
    <br>The dash "&mdash;" means that appropriate task is not needed.
</p>
<h4>Updating and saving</h4>
<p>
    To update the issues state click the orange "Update" button and wait for a moment.
    <br>All issues will be re-imported. All aggregated fields will be re-calculated and saved.
    <br>You can also update each issue separately. Click the update button
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-repeat"></span> near the issue key to do so.
</p>
<p>
    The CLR is being saved automatically after any update.
    <br>But you have to save additionally after any manual input, i.e. changing the progress, cl, or note.
</p>
<h3>Importing issues</h3>
<p>
    You can add any story, task or bug from this iteration to the Confidence Levels report.
    <br>To do so click the appropriate link after the "Import:".
    <br>Already imported issues will be hidden by default. Click the "Show imported" checkbox to show them.
</p>
<h3>Filtering issues</h3>
<p>
    Type a search keyword to filter issues by key, summary, note, status, progress.
    <br>Issues will be filtered on-the-fly as you will enter more than 2 symbols.
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>s: qa</code> or <code>s: tbd</code> or <code>s: %whatever%</code> to filter issues by aggregated status.
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>a: %name%</code> to filter issues by aggregated assignees.
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>t: %name%</code> to filter issues by developer who is responsible for TBD.
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>c: %component%</code> to filter issues by component.
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>tp: %type%</code> to filter issues by type (i.e. story, task or bug).
</p>
<p>
    Type <code>cl: %expr%</code> to filter issues by CL. Examples:
    <br><code>cl: 9</code> — shows issues with CL = 9.
    <br><code>cl: >6</code> — shows issues with CL > 6. Also works with "<".
    <br><code>cl: 4-6</code> — shows issues with CL between 4 and 6 (incl).
</p>
<p>
    You can also filter by multiple statuses, assignees or tester.
    Just type them separated by comma.
    <br>Ex.: <code>s: open, progress, doc</code> or <code>s: tbd, qa</code>.
